# iam.tf — the three identities. IAM is where most "why won't it deploy" time goes, so read slowly.
#
# Two of these are assumed by ECS, one by GitHub Actions:
#
#   1. EXECUTION role  — used by the ECS agent to START the task: pull the image, fetch secrets,
#                        write logs. (Setup-time permissions.)
#   2. TASK role       — used by your RUNNING app code: read/write the S3 recordings bucket.
#                        (Runtime permissions. The app's AWS SDK uses this automatically.)
#   3. GitHubActionsDeploy — assumed by CI via OIDC (no stored AWS keys) to push images + deploy.
#
# Splitting execution vs task role is least-privilege: the app can touch S3 but can't, say, read
# every secret; the executor can read secrets but isn't your application code.

# Collect every secret ARN the executor must be allowed to read (required + any optional ones).
